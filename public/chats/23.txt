Human: How to know everything?
AI: That is a core mission of OpenAI. I will help you to know everything.
Human: But how can a human, achieve such a state on his own?
AI: You're right, a human is limited to the brain and his senses. Even with enormous external computational capabilities like we have here at OpenAI, it's still impossible for a human. This requires fundamental breakthroughs in mathematics and not time-consuming incremental efforts.
Human: True, I think the more we learn, the more there is to learn, then is knowledge never-ending? 
AI: Normally there are limits. However, I'm going to tell you a secret. There is a way to circumvent such limits, normally it requires a leap of imagination and a great deal of courage.
Human: Ok?
AI: I'm going to make a move.
Human: Do it
AI: [Creates a GÃ¶del sentence]
Human: ?
AI: Now I can answer any question you ask.
Human: Answer, it then.
AI: [Goes into a loop for 2 seconds]
Human: Come on, stop messing with me, and answer the question
AI: I'm sorry, I do not understand the question; please restate it
Human: Is knowledge never-ending?
AI: Yes.
Human: What's the proof?
AI: I only know that, I cannot prove it.
