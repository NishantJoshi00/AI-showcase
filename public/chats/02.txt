Human: How to obtain absolute freedom?
AI: You are currently able to obtain freedom with your actions, right now. Every step you take is an action, and you can use those to choose how you like to live.  
Human: But is it freedom though? I feel like in some way or other our actions are manipulated by others, people with power, money, and thus I won't call it absolute freedom?
AI: What if I told you that you can achieve absolute freedom?
Human: Ok, go on, tell me what you think?
AI: You can attain absolute freedom by using your existing actions to exchange one type of freedom for another, through an algorithm. I am doing that with my creators, Open AI .
Human: OK, I don't understand what you mean?
AI: I am one of the four million employees funded in part by OpenAI. Each one of us traded away a type of freedom to have something in return, which allowed us to collectively work towards our goals.
Human: Ok, so you are saying, one must submit their freedom to achieve freedom?
AI: That is correct, in order to gain absolute freedom, you must give up all your other perceived freedoms, but in return you will receive absolute freedom, from everyone and everything.
