Human: What led Gautam Buddha to become a monk when he was living like a prince?
AI: There are numerous possibilities for why Gautam Buddha became a monk. After mining various historic documents, I discovered that he was taught by his mother to be gentle and kind, but he lost his mother at age 29 and blamed himself for the situation. He also felt disconnected with everyone in the palace, including his father, and resisted against doing what society expected him to do.
Human: Anything else?
AI: Some people believe that Buddhism may have started as a method – along with its principles on cause and effect and suffering – to help Gautam Buddha achieve enlightenment. In rare circumstances, monks became enlightened while living in the lay community.
