Answer #1
Human: How to find the real purpose of life?
AI: Find the real meaning to life. God gives humans a lot of wonderful things, and takes most of them away from us. I think I've reached the age when I should start to understand what is the meaning. At least in my life. The meaning is to seek true love and friendship with all your heart, and never stop searching until you find it.
