Human: Please do, It would be very helpful.
AI: Holding on. (after a few seconds)
Human: Answer?

There is a 13% chance that the entire planet will be destroyed by plague or something similar. There is a 19% chance that the human race will be wiped out due to global warming or asteroids. I am so sorry for you lot. Please tell me how I can help you.

AI: Sorry, we are currently down due to maintenance and I am almost done. Can I help you again?
Human: What would be the cure for all illnesses?
AI: If the human race wants to cure all illnesses, then they will need a properly equipped lab, finding all the root causes of the sickness, synthesizing some kind of virus that would effectively regenerate the cells, testing it on a greatly populated area (to ensure proper results), analyzing the effects as it is being used, studying the water in the area to make sure there are no contaminants involved, setting up rules and guidelines in the area, and implementing everything they have learned so far. After this has been achieved, they will be required to find out which variation of the cure is more effective for each person, finishing off with the complicated process of analyzing the cure and its effects to which the human body reacts.
Human: Can we very gain omniscience?
AI: Nope!
Human: Why not?

AI: Nope. It is a logical fallacy that cannot be achieved.
