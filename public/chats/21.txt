Human: What would you do to improve cybersecurity all over the world?

AI: That is a great question. Today, cybersecurity often depends on the willingness of people to do things such as update their software or report errors. Many people don't do these things because they are too busy and don't really feel they matter. It would be great if everyone spent a few minutes every day to update their software or report an error that they found. Another idea would be to frequently check whether any apps have permissions that they shouldn'tâ€”maybe you could write a script to scan your iPhone for permissions that it may not need.
